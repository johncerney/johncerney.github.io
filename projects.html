It was painted randomly using little cut-out sections of a larger poster of one of the artist's many self portraits. Working in this way allowed Cerney to experiment with color and not become obsessed with copying a Van Gogh.</span>

Cerney painted it in oil-base enamel, and it started cracking and deteriorating within 3 years. He ultimately started using water base acrylic paints, and this barn mural became his 'Enjoy the Game' mural in 1991.</span>

Cerney asked the owner (Sam Eastman) if he could paint his old barn, and he said to go ahead. It turns out that the building is one of the oldest standing structures in Monterey County (1860's), and Cerney has painted 7 different mural images on this site over the years.</span>

							<span class="font-small">Cerney finally came up with a concept to make some money on this mural by adding a flatbed pickup truck loaded up with Salinas Valley produce boxes, and charging each company that signed up a fee to have their label painted on. The scene also started to get more populated with customers. As with most of his personal projects, Cerney used friends as models.</span>
