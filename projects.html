Bob, a fieldman for Crown for over 50 years, was honored with this painting on his 80th birthday. It was originally installed on Highway 101 just south of Salinas, then moved a few years later to Highway 68 near the Salinas River. It was completely re-done in 2002 with the new acrylic paints that the artist now uses.</p>

				<h3>Tony's Friendly Auto Service-1983</h3>
				<p>
					Highway 68 near Salinas,CA (16 feet tall by 30 feet wide). Cerney's very first public art project after graduating from Cal State University Long Beach. Cerney asked the owner (Sam Eastman) if he could paint his old barn, and he said to go ahead. It turns out that the building is one of the oldest standing structures in Monterey County (1860's), and Cerney has painted 7 different mural images on this site over the years.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cerney wanted to refresh the mural and add some 3-dimensional elements to the scene, so he painted a gal in an old Corvette, and the service manager is sticking outside the right edge of the building. This version appeared in National Geographic Magazine in 1988.
				</p>

				<p>
					 Cerney finally came up with a concept to make some money on this mural by adding a flatbed pickup truck loaded up with Salinas Valley produce boxes, and charging each company that signed up a fee to have their label painted on. The scene also started to get more populated with customers. As with most of his personal projects, Cerney used friends as models.

				<h3>Phoenix Zoo (2002)</h3>
				<p>Dong Sun Kim did the actual painting of this giant anaconda greeting visitors to the Phoenix Zoo. It is larger than life, but not by much.</p>
				<a href="images/zoo2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/zoo2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p>Shown in Cerney's shop, this is a series of snakes created for the zoo that would hang in various areas to keep the visitors on their toes. Snakes were featured for this particular exhibit.</p>
				<a href="images/zoo3.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/zoo3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p> This scene sits at the entry to the capybara (worlds largest rodent) enclosure at the zoo, with a frightened feline for emphasis. Assisted by Dong Sun Kim.</p>

				<h3>Grapes of Wrath (1995)</h3>
				<p>12 feet tall by 16 feet wide. Installed alongside Highway 68 in Salinas as a teaser for the upcoming National Steinbeck Center, opened several months later. John Steinbeck is seen peeking behind one of the gas pumps in this 'still' from the Hollywood movie of Steinbeck's popular novel. Taken down in the early 2000's.</p>

				<h3>Sam's Friendly Produce Stand- 1997</h3>
				<p>
					This time working with Dong Sun Kim, Cerney said goodbye to Tony's and welcomed in Sam's.....Sam being named after Sam Eastman, the property owner. Real awnings installed, a cool old Corvette, and many more cutout people to create a buzz of activity.
				</p>

				<a href="images/sams2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/sams2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p>
					Cerney kept the revenue stream coming by employing a larger flatbed truck with even larger cartons than before.

				<h3>Enjoy the Drive (1985)</h3>
				<p>
					Located off Highway 101 in Aromas. 11 feet tall by 50 feet wide. One of Cerney's very early barn murals, and a rare one painted in black and white, it was just a fun message of not stressing out on your daily drive. Cerney painted it in oil-base enamel, and it started cracking and deteriorating within 3 years. He ultimately started using water base acrylic paints, and this barn mural became his 'Enjoy the Game' mural in 1991.

				<h3>Enjoy the Game (1991 & 2005)</h3>
				<p>This barn on Highway 101 north of Salinas changed its' theme from Enjoy the Drive to the baseball scene Enjoy the Game in 1991, and in this image from 2005 when it was totally restored. It depicts the 'golden era' of baseball from the 1940's and 50's. Revenue was derived from the sponsorship of the billboard panels and the fans in the stands. 12 feet tall by 50 feet wide.</p>

					<h3>Arm with Hat (1999)</h3>
					<p>Placed on Highway 68 on the edge of the Salinas River Bridge. The artwork is 8 feet tall, but it sits about 25 feet off the ground. Commissioned by the Crown Packing Company and meant to welcome people to the Salinas Valley. Perhaps the most curious mural the artist has painted, Cerney is often asked what happened to the head.</p>

					<h3>Another Landscape Painter (1994)</h3>

					<h3>Vincent Van Gogh (2000)</h3>
					<p>Nearly completed in this shot, it is a tribute mural to one of Cerney's favorite artists. The owners of the Star Shopping Center in Salinas, CA. paid for the supplies and allowed Cerney the use of a panel on a side street of the shopping center. It was painted randomly using little cut-out sections of a larger poster of one of the artist's many self portraits. Working in this way allowed Cerney to experiment with color and not become obsessed with copying a Van Gogh.</p>
