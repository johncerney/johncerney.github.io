				<a href="images/tonys2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/tonys1.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<h3>Tony's Friendly Auto Service-1983</h3>
				<p>
					Cerney's first mural after graduating from college. He convinced the building owner to let him paint the fake garage scene on Highway 68 just outside of Salinas, CA. The only 3-dimensional element was a Mastercard sign swinging from the wall.
				</p>

				<a href="images/tonys2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/tonys2.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>
					Cerney came back in 1986 to touch up the mural, but ended up totally restoring it and adding the cut-out red Corvette with woman, as well as a new service manager on the right, who extended beyond the building. This scene appeared in National Geographic Magazine in 1988.
				</p>

				<a href="images/tonys3.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/tonys3.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>
					In this 3rd version of Tony's done in 1991, different cars and more cutout figures start to dominate the scene. The tone is 'friendlier' as well, as there is now no charge for any repair work at Tony's.
				</p>

				<a href="images/tonys4.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/tonys4.jpg" alt="" /></a>

				<p>
					Cerney finally realized a way to make money on this mural by incorporating an old flatbed truck, broken down, carrying cartons of produce from various Salinas Valley growers & shippers. There was a charge to have your carton included, and the mural became technically a billboard now. The artist pays a yearly fee to Caltrans to keep up the mural.

				<h3>Sam's Friendly Produce Stand- 1997</h3>
				<p>
					This time working with Dong Sun Kim, Cerney said goodbye to Tony's and welcomed in Sam's.....Sam being named after Sam Eastman, the property owner. Real awnings installed, a cool old Corvette, and many more cutout people to create a buzz of activity.
				</p>

				<a href="images/sams2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/sams2.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p>
					Cerney kept the revenue stream coming by employing a larger flatbed truck with even larger cartons than before.
				</p>
				<a href="images/sams2.jpg" class="image"><img src="images/sams3.jpg" alt="" /></a>
				<p>
					In the foreground section, a little girl (Lizzie) pulls a wagon full of watermelons, dropping one. All figures were roughly life-size.

				<h3>Enjoy the Drive- 1985</h3>
				<p>
					Painted on the Alfred Costa Family barn on Highway 101 about 11 miles north of Salinas. Cerney wanted to paint a black & white mural and the message was to relax and enjoy the journey. He learned a lesson by using enamel based paints and seeing it flake off within 3 years. Cerney had to convince Mr. Costa to let him paint the barn by signing a document that he wouldn't sue if he fell off his ladder.
				</p>

					<h3>Vincent Van Gogh (2000)</h3>
					<p>Nearly completed in this shot, it is a tribute mural to one of Cerney's favorite artists. The owners of the Star Shopping Center in Salinas, CA. paid for the supplies and allowed Cerney the use of a panel on a side street of the shopping center. It was painted randomly using little cut-out sections of a larger poster of one of the artist's many self portraits. Working in this way allowed Cerney to experiment with color and not become obsessed with copying a Van Gogh.</p>
